Details
----------

By default, the writing statement in ckMPIconf.py is commented out to check configuration and avoid unnecessary modification at the same time. If everything is okay and rewriting is needed, please just uncomment.

If you just want to have a local test, please remove --path=/your/OpenMPI/config/file/folder/ in run.conf.py.

Usage
----------
